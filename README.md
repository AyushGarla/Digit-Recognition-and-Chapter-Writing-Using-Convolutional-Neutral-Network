Chapter writing on CNN: I have explained the CNN architure, its working and the modules used in detail with live examples and images.

Project:
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The process begins with data preprocessing, including loading the training and test data, normalizing the pixel values, and reshaping the data into the appropriate format for the CNN. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling and dropout layers to reduce overfitting. A fully connected dense layer with a softmax activation is used to output probabilities for the ten digit classes.

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, and data augmentation is applied to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. The network is trained on the training set and evaluated on a validation set, with performance metrics such as loss and accuracy tracked. The model's predictions are further analyzed using a confusion matrix to evaluate its accuracy across different digit classes.
